I am a PhD student in Theoretical Biology at ETH Zürich supervised by [Sebastian Bonhoeffer](https://tb.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.sbonhoeffer.html) and co-supervised by [Roland Regös](https://tb.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.roland-regoes.html) and [Roger Kouyos](https://www.usz.ch/team/roger-kouyos/). My research interest lies in obtaining a better understanding of the causes and effectivnes of intervention strategies for combating the rise of antimicrobial resistance, and especially multi-drug resistance. To answer my questions, I use tools from mathematical modelling and statistics, in particular causal inference. 

Perviously, I have completed my MSc in Applied Mathematics under the supervision of [Jonas Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/) and have worked as a research assistent at the Chair of Marcroeconomics: Innovation and Policy, and the KOF Lab (Swiss Economic Institute) under the supervision of [Hans Gersbach](http://www.gersbach.de/).
