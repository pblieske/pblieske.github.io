I am a PhD student in Theoretical Biology at ETH Zürich supervised by [Sebastian Bonhoeffer](https://tb.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.sbonhoeffer.html) and co-supervised by [Roland Regös](https://tb.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.roland-regoes.html) and [Roger Kouyos](https://www.usz.ch/team/roger-kouyos/). My research interest lies obtaining a better understanding of the causes and effectivnes of intervention strategies for combating the rise of antimicrobial resistance, and especially multi-drug resistance. To answer my questions, I use tools from mathematical modelling and statistics, in particular causal inference.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
